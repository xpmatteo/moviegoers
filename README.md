This repo is part of an ongoing series of exercises for me to learn how to 
write web apps that perform like Single Page Applications, only **faster**, 
with Go and HTMX.

This is an [MTDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) client, which is a 
[standard SPA example project](https://github.com/tastejs/movies/blob/main/spec.md). 
The UI is inspired by [this Angular sample](https://angular-movies-a12d3.web.app/list/category/popular); most features
are yet to be implemented, but those that are, are **faster**.

The app is fully usable without JavaScript.

TODO
 * Click to get movie details
 * Options: Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming (currently it's Upcoming)
 * Make it possible to switch genre on mobile
